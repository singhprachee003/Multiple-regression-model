# Multiple-regression-model
The multiple regression and KNN model can be performed by using age, gender, family size, membership, and discount card type as explanatory variable (independent variable) and purchase amount as the response variable (dependent variable).
This is done to predict the future pharchase amount of an individual to give them offer or discount based on that amount.
